# Define the environment variables required by your application.
# For security, do not hardcode secret values here.
# Instead, use the Firebase CLI to set the values:
# firebase apphosting:backends:update --backend=<your-backend-id> --update-env-vars=SECRET_COOKIE_PASSWORD="YOUR_SECRET_VALUE_HERE"
#
# NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables can often be set directly here if they are not sensitive.
# However, it's best practice to manage all environment-specific configurations
# in the Firebase console or via the CLI.
#
# You will need to set values for all of these in your Firebase App Hosting backend settings.

  # This value MUST be set as a secret in your App Hosting backend.
